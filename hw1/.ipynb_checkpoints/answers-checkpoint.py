part2_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
When increasing the K, we will get worse results for the new points in the test part, as increasing k leads to improved generalization for unseen data. When K is small, the model is overfitted, and less generalized. This is because, for small K, we are more influenced by each point separately, including the more anomalous points (outliers). But, eventually, as K is increased further, we decide the label of the unseen data by the majority of points surrounding it, and thus, each point has a smaller weight in the decision. Eventually, when we increase K, the model is too general and could lead to a decrease in accuracy. It is especially decreased when the groups vary in size, and small groups could disappear completely for the unseen data.
